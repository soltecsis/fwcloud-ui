# FWCloud-UI
<a href="https://fwcloud.net/en/documentation/user-interface/">FWCloud-UI</a> is the user interface of the <a href="https://fwcloud.net">FWCloud</a> project. It allows us to manage all our firewall clouds. It is a web interface accessible through browsers such as Chrome or Firefox, developed using the Angular framework thanks to which it has a desktop application behavior, even if itâ€™s ran within our web browser.

It is a fairly simple and intuitive application to manage for users accustomed to working with Linux based firewalls.

We have several <a href="https://fwcloud.net/en/documentation/user-interface/#video">tutorial videos</a> that will help you understand how to use FWCloud and the most advisable use practices. These videos are part of our YouTube channel, which we will update as we add new features to FWCloud-UI.
